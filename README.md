# AI Translator

AI-powered English to Spanish translation system utilizing neural network modeling and a user-friendly interface.

## Description

The AI Translator project is an intelligent system designed to bridge language barriers by translating text from English to Spanish. This system leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to understand and translate languages effectively. The repository includes all necessary components to preprocess data, train the neural network model, evaluate its performance, and interact with the model through a graphical user interface.

## Features

- English to Spanish text translation using a trained Seq2Seq LSTM model.
- Data preprocessing scripts to prepare datasets for training.
- Model training and evaluation code to fine-tune and assess performance.
- A GUI for easy interaction with the translation model by end-users.

## Installation

To install and run the AI Translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/henriquetreve/AI-Translator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd AI-Translator

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the AI Translator, start the GUI application and enter the English text you wish to translate. The system will provide you with the Spanish translation in real-time.
